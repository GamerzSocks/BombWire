The Bombwire Project
By Gamerz


The Bombwire is a simple and effective way to annoy your friends. You can use the safe one to absolutely roast the HELL out of them, are you can just straight up shut down their
computer. Just make sure everything is saved on your friends computer. The red one is the roast one, and blue one is the shutdown one.
Please use this responsibly, and thank you to everyone who helped unknowingly test the software


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Redwire (SAFE);
from the code section, click on the file "RedWireSafe.vbs"
in the top right, there is a option to download the raw file.
You can then launch the .vbs file.

BlueWire (Unsafe):

From the code section, click on and open the contents of the BlueWire (exploding one)
once again, download the raw file, however, be careful, as once it's open, then the only way to stop it is the task manager,
so if there is an option, use show in folder.
